# ðŸ“† Office Hours

**Note:** This page only contains the office hours schedule for **methodology** office hours.
- To see the areas of expertise for each TA, and to see the TA assigned to your domain, check the [ðŸ™‹ Staff](../staff) page.
- Ask your domain mentor for their office hours; they will not appear in this calendar.

**All office hours are held in-person in [HDSI](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246301). Check the calendar for specific rooms, since they're all held in different rooms.**

If you'd like to meet with someone and can't make it to their office hours, feel free to send them an email to schedule an appointment; emails can be found on the [ðŸ™‹ Staff](../staff) page.
