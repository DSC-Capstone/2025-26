# Design Thinking and Opportunity Framing
Design thinking is valuable for startup entrepreneurs because it emphasizes understanding real customer needs and encourages creative, user-centered solutions. 
By rapidly prototyping and testing ideas, entrepreneurs can refine their products/solution, reduce risk, and improve their chances of market success. 
It also fosters collaboration and innovation, helping startups develop solutions that are both practical and desirable.

# Customer Discovery
Customer discovery is essential for entrepreneurs because it helps them understand the real needs and pain points of potential customers. 
Conducting interviews early allows them to collect relevant, firsthand data, uncover insights that may not be apparent from surveys or assumptions, 
and validate their business ideas early. By engaging in customer discovery from the start, entrepreneurs can design and test hypotheses,
guide product/solution development, reduce risk, ensure the solution meets market demand, and identify the right customer segments while building 
early relationships that support growth. Watch [this video](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMG-0zOxYXlbPd-qN9rznKAVA9QK505a/view?usp=drive_link__;!!Mih3wA!AWwLYfiZ4PZc36-cn57r69mBa9koA2aLw3aoQH6Q2M_B_4HMEVYfbg-f88ex9PEkmjvh31zcQ725Q7iq0g$) for more on this topic.
